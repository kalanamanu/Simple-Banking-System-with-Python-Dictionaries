    Implement a function to allow users to create bank accounts with initial balances.
    Ensure that each account has a unique account number.

5. Deposit and Withdrawal:

    Create functions for depositing and withdrawing money from user accounts.
    Update account balances accordingly.

6. Account Balance Inquiry:

    Implement a feature for users to check their account balances.

7. Transaction History:

13. User Interface Enhancements:

    Enhance the user interface to provide a user-friendly experience.
    Use clear prompts and messages to guide users through different operations.

14. Logging (Optional):
